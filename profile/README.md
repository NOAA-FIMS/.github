# The [NOAA Fisheries Integrated Modeling System](https://noaa-fims.github.io/) GitHub Organization 

In this organization you can find repositories associated with the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS). For a high-level overview of what FIMS is, please refer to [our official announcement](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fisheries-integrated-modeling-system). For more detailed information please navigate to [our website](https://noaa-fims.github.io/). Below is a list of other relevant resources

- [FIMS Google drive folder (Team members only)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1weGhwrvDEBEyRnJ-bEeMrsFtwloEdow4?usp=sharing)

FIMS is a software system designed to support next-generation fisheries stock assessment, ecosystem, and socioeconomic modeling. A team of experts within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the FIMS Council which includes academic, industry, and international partners. Read our [About page](https://noaa-fims.github.io/about/) on the website for more information, introduce yourself on our [GitHub Discussion Board](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions/801), or [email the FIMS Project Lead](mailto:kelli.johnson@noaa.gov) if you have questions.
